Game Pillars:

## INTRODUCTION:
In this subject we have to create a game from scratch. This is a process that demands imagination and creativeness yes, but also teamwork and organization. 
Game Pillars are a very important and helpful part of this process.
Game pillars are those 3 to 5 elements/characteristics that your video game is mainly exploring and paying attention to design and production wise. Examples “pvp combat”, “scavenging”, “flexible mechanics”, “stealth”, “Replayability”, “parkour” (dying light)

Game pillars should be set at the beginning of the process, once the developers know the basic idea of their game (genre, theme, etc). For example, once a team knows they want a platformer about a girl in a dream world they should think about what they want to focus on, since with the same concept the game could go in infinite directions. Which is a concept I will develop more later. 

## UTILITY AND IMPORTANCE
As I said, game pillars are an important part of the development of a game if you and your team choose to use them. But why? How can they be useful?
Set a base and objectives everybody has agreed to. “We all know we want THIS out of this game” = be on the same page at the start of the game, at least.
Keep the focus. “We could do this but first we need to finish this other aspect because it’s closer to the game pillars than that one”
Solve arguments and disagreements. When there is a difference of opinion referring to game pillars helps by providing an objective way to decide. This also helps with taking fast decisions.


## EXAMPLES + PROFESSIONAL GAMES
How hard do game pillars affect the developing process:
Platformers with different game pillars = completely different platformers. Let’s think of some game pillars this team could propose: “fluid mechanics” (celeste, ori), “story”, “artistic aesthetic” (gris), “challenge” (getting over it).

# Examples:
# THE LAST OF US:
Crafting: This is a big mechanic in the game that helps build progressively better ammo and other ways to fight.
Story: It is a game with strong and emotional narrative which has impacted many who played it with the relationships and scenery displayed. 
AI partners: The game creates heavy emotional attachment by presenting you with other characters who you care for eventually, like Ellie.
Stealth: Combat is used in this game, but if you avoid it, the game can be a lot easier and comfortable. So, the player is encouraged to play more stealthily.

# ZELDA
Exploration: Players are encouraged to explore, by being able to go literally anywhere they wish to.
Freedom
Scavenging: players need to go through the world and search for items. Weapons break, you feel hunger, cold, heat, etc climate areas, accessible places.
Options: millions of options given to the player. Multiple ways to solve puzzles, ways to move around, make your own adventure. Anything the player thinks of will probably be possible.
Realistic mechanics: the world interacts with itself. Any form of fire gives you heat, lightning is a way to create fire.

# SUBNAUTICA
VESSEL DESIGN / BUILDING (Intoxicating Creation) The overwhelming excitement of being able to build anything. “I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he see some creation of the brain undfoling to success.. Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.” - Nikola Tesla 1943
EXPLORATION, DISCOVERY (Thrill of the Unknown) Excitement, dread, and tension of exploring the unknown. No idea what dangers/rewards are down there. Increased risk generally associated with increased reward.
CHALLENGE, TEAMWORK, INTERDEPENDENT SYSTEMS(Cascading Hysteria) (uncontrollable outburst of emotion, fear, irrationality, laughter, weeping, etc) - FTL style chain of “oh shit” dependencies, where a failure in one system can affect others, until you’re suddenly in trouble (sensors stops working, can’t see enemies onboard). Creates urgency, drama, impetus, teamwork, interrelatedness.

# JOURNEY
Exploration, sense of wonder
Inmersiveness
Fluid movement, ethereal feeling

# ASSASSIN’S CREED 2 (Patrick plourde - AC2 Gamedesigner)
Fight
Navigation
Social Stealth
Ubisoft then designed the game around these three gameplay pillars. For example, for fighting, they added tactical player choices like new moves, disarming new enemies, and new tools (e.g., weapons). They also focused on the challenge of navigation coming from the environment and not from player controls. The fluidity map above shows how complex the environment is to navigate. The fluid movement is not in the way of navigational decision-making, which is the core challenge that the game was going for. So, you can move around while planning your next move, jump, or escape route. Social stealth was the third gameplay pillar, and it is evidenced by the ability of the Assassin to use the crowd as a gameplay tool. The player can take advantage of the environment by using crowds and benches to disappear. The social behaviour of the Assassin will trigger reactions from the game’s world.


## CREATING YOUR OWN GAME PILLARS & GOOD AND BAD GAME PILLARS
I made a document which gives everybody tips and guidance to what makes a good game pillar. 

# 1) We can do whatever we want stage
When you start your game and want to establish your game pillars you must ask yourself:
What's the experience you're trying to get the player to feel in the moment to moment gameplay?
To name a few: Is it tactical planning? Quick action? Imposing fear? Confusion? Confidence of purpose? Add that to what makes your game different from everything else. Each place you go is a tiny planet. Everything can be destroyed. Everything can become your friend. Whatever it is will be special to your game.
Every team member must ask themselves these questions and must brainstorm a few possible game pillars without thinking of any restrictions, whatever you want to have, say it, in order to get a few that will actually pass the next step. 
Tips:
**THEME:** Pillars that fit with the theme and the genre (ex if you have planned a game about mental health and overcoming trauma like celeste, don’t make one of your pillars be “good first person shooting mechanics” or “gore aesthetic”)
**SYNERGY:** Start thinking about pillars that compliment each other, this will be repeated in step 3 but it’s good to start thinking about it. (ex: exploration + scavenging, story focused + character attachment)
**MEANING:** Meaningless things like “fun”, “deep”, “for every age”. These will not work as well because they either focus on things that are too general (“deep”) without actually offering something useful to be guided by - instead of “deep” say what deep topic you want to focus on like “good representation on how depression feels” or “give an insight in the trauma of losing a child” like a game called “That dragon, cancer”. 
**FOCUS:** Too small concepts like: “be able to climb things”, “be able to have pets”, etc. Try to thing about why you want this particular thing to be important and extrapolate. From “be able to climb things” to “no limits on the map, everything is accessible” like for example zelda breath of the wild.

Once you have a good list of pillars, go to step 2.

# 2) Filtering the game pillars
Now that you have a list of things you want your game to have, it’s time to think practically and decide with your team which pillars are the best to set.
In this step we have to take into account budget, time frame, target audience,etc.

Now you should make every pillar pass a quick exam by asking these questions:
Can we afford making this a game pillar? Is it in our budget?
Try breaking down what parts of the process this game pillar would affect and what you would have to implement. Then, knowing your team and your resources, calculate if it is a viable game pillar budget wise.
Will we be able to implement this game pillar before our deadline?
Try breaking down what parts of the process this game pillar would affect and what you would have to implement. Then, knowing your team and your resources, calculate if it is a viable game pillar time wise.
Is this game pillar attractive towards our target audience?
If you haven’t thought about your audience yet, this is the time to do so, will this be attractive? Will 8 year old kids want a pillar that is “strategy and complicated puzzles”?
Is this game pillar going to help us sell our game?
This has to do with the target audience point but, if you are focused on having revenue out of this game (which we are not, but in the future we probably will), what are some pillars you know work well and have led to successful games? What is the market and the people asking for?

# 3) Final decision
With your team, look at the possible game pillar you have left and discuss what you want. It can be useful to look at the Synergy point in step 1 to make your final decision. This is all about what you as a team want this game to become, so once your game pillars have passed the first and second step, you can focus on picking which ones work best for you and your team. 

# 4) Stick to your game pillars!!
This step is as long as the development process. You and your team have put effort and thought into these game pillars, so stick to them! As mentioned before, if you treat them as immobile facts, they will help you stay focused, solve discussions and make quick decisions.

Would it be bad to change a pillar mid process?
Well yes, it would be bad, because the efficiency that brings setting pillars at the beginning would be shattered. But it can be done if 
FIRST your whole team agrees with you, 
SECOND you have a good reason to change one or add one (Not a good idea to add a pillar just because you like it, think about a list of reasons why you think the game would work better with this change and present it to your team)
THIRD your process is not too advanced, because it would just be inconvenient to throw everything you have done (unless, of course, you have implemented in your list of reasons that what you want to eliminate or change is damaging the game)
